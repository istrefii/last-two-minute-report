Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

Comment:           Lillard (POR) legally contests Harden's (HOU) jump shot attempt.

Comment:           Harden (HOU) makes contact to Nurkic's (POR) arm and affects his SQBR.

     Q4            01:39.0          Foul: Shooting                                           Clint Capela                                    Damian Lillard             IC          Video
Comment:           Capela (HOU) makes contact to Lillardâ€™s (POR) off-arm as he brings the ball upwards, but before he has gathered. Since Lillard
                   cannot be in a shooting motion on a jump shot before he has gathered the ball, this should be ruled a personal foul.
