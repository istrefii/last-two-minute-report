Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         Millsap (ATL) hand checks Rudez (MIN) at the start of his drive, affecting his RSBQ.
     Q4           01:42.0                         Foul: Shooting                                              Damjan Rudez                                                    Paul Millsap            CNC             Video
Comment:         LATR shows that Rudez (MIN) and Dieng (MIN) maintain legal guarding positions when defending Millsap (ATL) on his layup attempt.
     Q4           01:26.0                         Foul: Personal                                            Thabo Sefolosha                                                 Andrew Wiggins            CNC             Video
Comment:         Sefolosha (ATL) makes incidental hand contact to Wiggins' (MIN) body and arm that do not affect his RSBQ as he starts his drive.
     Q4           01:25.0                         Foul: Shooting                                               Paul Millsap                                                 Andrew Wiggins             CC             Video
Comment:         RATR shows that Millsap (ATL) does not maintain a vertical position when defending Wiggins (MIN) on his shot attempt. Millsap's arms are not vertical when contact
                 occurs.
     Q4           01:14.0                         Foul: Offensive                                               Al Horford                                                    Zach LaVine             CNC             Video
Comment:         Horford (ATL) sets a legal screen on LaVine (MIN). Since LaVine is stationary and Horford is in an area that could be visible to LaVine, Horford does not need to give him any
                 room and he absorbs contact.
     Q4           01:12.0                         Foul: Personal                                              Gorgui Dieng                                                    Jeff Teague             CNC             Video

     Q4           01:11.0                         Foul: Personal                                               Zach LaVine                                                     Al Horford             CNC             Video
Comment:         RATR shows Horford (ATL) loses the ball with no contact from LaVine (MIN).

Comment:         LHH shows Sefolosha (ATL) cleanly blocks LaVine's (MIN) shot attempt, making incidental contact prior to his upward shooting motion when he turns around.
     Q4           00:44.4               Turnover: 24 Second Violation                                                                                                                                  CC             Video
Comment:         Minnesota regains possession after the blocked shot attempt and commits a 24 second violation.
     Q4           00:22.0                         Foul: Shooting                                                Al Horford                                                  Andrew Wiggins            CNC             Video
Comment:         Horford (ATL) maintains a legal guarding position as he defends Wiggins' (MIN) shot attempt.
     Q4           00:19.9                        Foul: Loose Ball                                           Andrew Wiggins                                                    Paul Millsap            CNC             Video
Comment:         Wiggins (MIN) and Millsap (ATL) make incidental contact in their attempt to secure the rebound.
     Q4           00:14.6                         Foul: Personal                                               Zach LaVine                                                    Jeff Teague              CC             Video
Comment:         R-Slash shows that LaVine (MIN) makes contact with Teague's (ATL) head on his drive to the rim, but before he begins an upward shooting motion.
