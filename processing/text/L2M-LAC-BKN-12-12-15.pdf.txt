Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         The pass made by Johnson (BKN) is deflected into the backcourt by Johnson (LAC).
     Q4           01:35.0                         Foul: Personal                                             Jamal Crawford                                                 Andrea Bargnani            CC             Video
Comment:         Crawford (LAC) holds Bargnani's (BKN) arm as the ball goes into the post area.
     Q4           01:28.0                    Foul: Defense 3 Second                                         Andrea Bargnani                                                                                           Video
Comment:         [Detectable with stop watch] Bargnani (BKN) is in the lane twice without actively guarding an opponent for just over 3 secs. He clears, but is off by a fraction of a second in
                 each case. This is a technical violation as Bargnani is clearly trying to keep to the intention of the rule.
     Q4           01:26.0                         Foul: Personal                                            Thaddeus Young                                                     Chris Paul             CNC             Video
Comment:         Young (BKN) maintains legal guarding position and does not affect Paul's (LAC) FOM on the perimeter.
     Q4           00:49.0                         Foul: Offensive                                              Brook Lopez                                                 Luc Mbah a Moute           CNC             Video
Comment:         Lopez (BKN) sets the screen on Mbah a Moute (LAC) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           00:39.0                   Foul: Defense 3 Second                                             Brook Lopez                                                         ,                  INC             Video
Comment:         Lopez (BKN) is straddling the lane line and therefore inside the lane for more than three seconds without actively guarding an opponent.
     Q4           00:28.0                         Foul: Offensive                                              Brook Lopez                                                 Luc Mbah a Moute           CNC             Video
Comment:         Lopez (BKN) sets the screen on Mbah a Moute (LAC) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           00:19.0                         Foul: Shooting                                            DeAndre Jordan                                                    Jarrett Jack            CNC             Video

Comment:         Rivers' (LAC) contact with Lopez (BKN) is incidental and does not affect his shot.
     Q4           00:15.1                         Foul: Personal                                                Jarrett Jack                                                   Chris Paul              CC             Video
