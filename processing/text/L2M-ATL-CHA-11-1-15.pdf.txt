Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

                                                                             (CC = Correct Call, IC = Incorrect Call, CNC = Correct Non-Call, INC = Incorrect Non-Call)

     Q4           01:59.0                         Foul: Personal                                             Kemba Walker                                                     Jeff Teague              CC             Video
Comment:         L-Slash shows Walker (CHA) grab Teague (ATL), preventing from gathering the ball.
     Q4           01:44.0                      Turnover: Traveling                                            Nicolas Batum                                                                                           Video
Comment:         [Observable in enhanced video] L-Slash slo-mo shows Batum (CHA) gather the ball in the air, land on R-foot (pivot foot) just before coming down on his L. He then moves
                 his R-foot when starting to dribble. Had the gather occurred with his left foot down, he could have moved either foot.
     Q4           01:38.0                         Foul: Shooting                                               Paul Millsap                                                  Kemba Walker              CC             Video
Comment:         Millsap (ATL) turns and delivers contact on Walker's (CHA) layup.
     Q4           00:14.8                         Foul: Personal                                             Spencer Hawes                                                   Kent Bazemore             CC             Video
Comment:         LHH shows Williams (CHA) trip Bazemore (ATL) as he grabs the rebound.
     Q4           00:14.0                         Foul: Offensive                                             Nicolas Batum                                                   Paul Millsap                            Video
Comment:         [Incidental or immaterial] Batum (CHA) sets the screen on Millsap (ATL) and gives him the opportunity to avoid the contact.
     Q4           00:10.7                         Foul: Personal                                            Marvin Williams                                                    Al Horford             INC             Video
Comment:         LATR shows that Williams (CHA) gets a hand on the ball as Horford (ATL) attempts to gather the pass. As Zeller (CHA) and Lin (CHA) attempt to gain possession, Williams
                 reaches underneath Horford's leg and contributes to his fall.
     Q4           00:08.7                        Foul: Loose Ball                                              Paul Millsap                                                 Marvin Williams           INC             Video
Comment:         When attempting to retrieve the loose ball, Millsap (ATL) hits Williams (CHA) in the head with his forearm before landing on him. While loose ball play is inherently
                 physical, players may not behave recklessly.
