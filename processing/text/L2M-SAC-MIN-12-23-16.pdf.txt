Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during overtime,
where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the outcome of a
possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly officiated. Events that are
indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch, zoom or other technical
support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further review. If you have any
questions, please contact the NBA here.
