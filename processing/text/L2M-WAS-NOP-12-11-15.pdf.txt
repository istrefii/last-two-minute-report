Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         Dudley (WAS) does not obtain a legal guarding position, as he is still sliding to his right prior to the contact with Davis (NOP) that affects his movement to the basket and
                 shot attempt.
     Q4           01:00.0                         Foul: Personal                                              Anthony Davis                                                   Jared Dudley            INC             Video
Comment:         LATR shows that Davis (NOP) makes contact with Dudley's (WAS) wrist when he makes the pass.

Comment:         Davis (NOP) sets the screen on Temple (WAS) who avoids the contact.
     Q4           00:34.6                        Foul: Loose Ball                                            Garrett Temple                                                  Anthony Davis            INC             Video
Comment:         Temple (WAS) faces up and holds Davis (NOP) affecting his ability to retrieve the rebound.
     Q4           00:25.8                         Foul: Offensive                                             Marcin Gortat                                                   Alonzo Gee              CNC             Video
Comment:         Gortat (WAS) sets the screen on Gee (NOP) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           00:23.4                        Foul: Loose Ball                                              Alonzo Gee                                                    Marcin Gortat            CNC             Video
Comment:         Gee (NOP) and Gortat (WAS) briefly engage and separate during rebounding. Since neither player's ability to retrieve the rebound is affected, the contact is considered
                 incidental.
     Q4           00:18.1                         Foul: Personal                                               Otto Porter                                                    Eric Gordon              CC             Video

Comment:         A jump ball is correctly called since both Holiday (NOP) and Dudley (WAS) had possession of the ball at the same time.

Comment:         Porter (WAS) commits a take foul on Evans (NOP).
     Q4           00:04.7                         Foul: Offensive                                               Gary Neal                                                     Alonzo Gee              CNC             Video
