Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         Towns (MIN) sets the screen on Harris (DEN) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           00:10.7                        Foul: Loose Ball                                            Danilo Gallinari                                               Andrew Wiggins            CNC             Video

     Q4           00:09.5                         Foul: Shooting                                             Danilo Gallinari                                               Andrew Wiggins            CNC             Video
Comment:         After the incidental contact with Gallinari (DEN) while jumping for the rebound, Wiggins (MIN) attempts a jump shot as he falls backwards to the floor. No illegal contact is
