Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         Adams (OKC) firms up as he sets the screen on Leonard (SAS) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           01:50.0                         Foul: Offensive                                              Serge Ibaka                                                    Danny Green             CNC             Video
Comment:         Ibaka (OKC) makes incidental contact with Green (SAS) that does not affect his ability to defend.
     Q4           01:34.0                         Foul: Personal                                               Serge Ibaka                                                   Kawhi Leonard            CNC             Video
Comment:         Ibaka (OKC) and Leonard (SAS) engage and separate away from the ball.
     Q4           01:31.0                         Foul: Offensive                                          LaMarcus Aldridge                                               Russell Westbrook          INC             Video
Comment:         Since Westbrook (OKC) is stationary, Aldridge (SAS) can establish himself in his path without giving him room to avoid the screen. However, Aldridge does not maintain his
                 legal position when he pushes Westbrook off balance.
     Q4           01:17.0                         Foul: Offensive                                             Steven Adams                                                    Danny Green             CNC             Video

Comment:         Green (SAS) legally contests Durant's (OKC) jump shot attempt. Any "high-five" contact after the release is considered incidental.

Comment:         Green (SAS) maintains legal guarding position and makes incidental contact with Durant (OKC) that does not affect his drive to the basket and shot attempt. After the shot
                 has been released, Duncan (SAS) makes incidental contact with Durant.
     Q4           00:29.6                      Turnover: Traveling                                             Tony Parker                                                                                            Video
