Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         RHH and LATR show Joseph (TOR) gets into a screening position on Pachulia (DAL), giving him enough room to avoid the contact and absorbing contact when it occurs.

Comment:         R-Slash Valanciunas (TOR) gets into a screening position on Williams (DAL), giving him enough room to avoid the screen. He takes a wide stance, but firms up over his
                 leg as contact occurs, absorbing the contact in his shoulder (not legs).

Comment:         Valanciunas (TOR) first clamps Matthews (DAL) and then dislodges him while trying to establish post position. Call should have been made sooner, but correct.
