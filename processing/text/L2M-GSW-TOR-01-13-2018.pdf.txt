Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

      Q4             00:06.9           Turnover: Out of Bounds                                 Kevin Durant                                                                    CNC       Video
Comment:             Durant (GSW) does not dribble the ball out of bounds, step out of bounds with possession of the ball, or touch the ball while out
                     of bounds. While a correct no-call, it is worth noting that this aspect of the out-of-bounds play was not a reviewable matter or
                     considered in the review decision since it occurred prior to the actual call and deemed to be part of a separate sequence.

      Q4             00:05.1           Turnover: Stepped out of Bounds                          Jakob Poeltl                                                                   CNC       Video

Comment:             After communicating with the Replay Center, the ruling on the floor of Raptors possession is overturned and the Warriors are
                     awarded possession because the ball touches DeRozan’s (TOR) leg while his body is out of bounds before Curry (GSW) knocks the ball
                     out. Referees were able to review two aspects of this out-of-bounds play since they were part of the same sequence.
