Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

Comment:           Thompson (GSW) maintains legal guarding position defending Harden (HOU) and makes contact with the ball, allowing Harden
                   to regain possession. There is no foul or traveling violation on the play. Officials correctly determine that the call on the floor
                   is an inadvertent whistle and the ball is given to the Rockets.

Comment:             Green (GSW) grabs the rebound, takes a controlled dribble, and passes the ball to Durant (GSW) prior to officials recognizing the
                     timeout. Therefore, the Warriors cannot advance the ball following the timeout.
