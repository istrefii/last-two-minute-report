Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         After communicating with the Replay Center, the ruling on the court of a 3 point field goal by Holiday (NOP) at the 3:30 mark of the 4th quarter was confirmed.
     Q4           01:36.0                         Foul: Shooting                                              Tyreke Evans                                                  DeAndre Jordan             CC             Video
Comment:         Evans (NOP) makes contact with Jordan's (LAC) arm that affects his dunk attempt.
     Q4           01:29.0                         Foul: Offensive                                              Eric Gordon                                                 Luc Mbah a Moute           CNC             Video

Comment:         RHH shows that Holiday (NOP) maintains legal guarding position and cleanly strips the ball from Paul (LAC). Any hand to hand contact after the ball becomes loose is
                 considered incidental.

Comment:         After communicating with the Replay Center, there was conclusive video evidence that showed the ball was last touched by Paul (LAC) prior to going OOB. The ruling on the
                 court was overturned and New Orleans was awarded possession.

Comment:         Evans (NOP) pushes Jordan (LAC) while he is airborne on the made alley-oop layup attempt.
     Q5           04:21.0                         Foul: Offensive                                         Dante Cunningham                                                  Wesley Johnson            CNC             Video
Comment:         Cunningham (NOP) sets the screen on Johnson (LAC) and gives him room to avoid the contact. The two players make incidental foot to foot contact that does not affect
                 Johnson's ability to defend.
     Q5           04:20.0                      Turnover: Traveling                                            Tyreke Evans                                                                                            Video
Comment:         [Observable in enhanced video] RHH and freeze frame show that Evans (NOP) jumps and lands prior to releasing the pass. The official is looking for any point of contact on
                 a potential shot attempt and does not see the feet on this play.

Comment:         After the shot has been released, Jordan (LAC) dislodges Anderson (NOP) during rebounding. The successful field goal attempt should be scored and Jordan called for a
                 loose ball foul.
     Q5           03:26.0                         Foul: Personal                                                Chris Paul                                                   Ryan Anderson             CC             Video
