Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

     Q4           01:08.0                         Foul: Personal                                               Kobe Bryant                                                  Kristaps Porzingis        CNC             Video
Comment:         New York is granted a timeout before the contact by Bryant (LAL) on Porzingis (NYK). The dead ball contact is not enough to warrant a technical or flagrant foul.

Comment:         RHH shows Anthony (NYK) make contact with Bryant's (LAL) hand while it is in contact with the ball, causing him to lose control. Contact which occurs on the hand of
                 the offensive player, while that hand is in contact with the ball, is legal.
