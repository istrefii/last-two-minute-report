Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         Curry (GSW) signals for a timeout after Thompson (GSW) secures the ball, but it is not acknowledged by officials. The trail official acknowledges the timeout request
                 from Golden State's head coach at the 0:01.8 mark after Thompson has already dribbled. Because Thompson dribbled prior to the timeout being granted, the clock
                 should not have been reset and Golden State should not have had the option to advance the ball to the 28' hash mark upon resumption of play. The ball should
                 have been inbounded on the sideline where play was interrupted with 0:01.8 remaining on the clock. Golden State should have had to request an additional
                 timeout in order to advance the ball in this situation, but they did not have any timeouts remaining.
