Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

     Q4           01:59.0                         Foul: Shooting                                             Kenneth Faried                                                  Nikola Vucevic           CNC             Video
Comment:         Faried (DEN) maintains legal guarding position as he defends Vucevic's (ORL) shot attempt.
     Q4           01:52.0                         Foul: Shooting                                              Tobias Harris                                                  Kenneth Faried           CNC             Video
Comment:         RHH shows that Fournier (ORL) and Harris (ORL) legally contest Faried's (DEN) shot attempt.
     Q4           01:44.0                         Foul: Shooting                                             Jameer Nelson                                                    Elfrid Payton            CC             Video
Comment:         Nelson (DEN) does not obtain a legal guarding position prior to the contact with Payton (ORL). The contact causes Payton to bobble the ball, but he recovers the loose ball
                 in one motion and continuation is correctly awarded.

Comment:         Payton (ORL) sets the screen on Nelson (DEN) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           00:37.9                         Foul: Shooting                                             Kenneth Faried                                                   Elfrid Payton            CC             Video
