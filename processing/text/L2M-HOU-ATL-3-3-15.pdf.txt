Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during overtime,
where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the outcome of a
possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch, zoom or other
technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are denoted with an *. The league may change an opinion after further review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If
you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

                land .
     Q4           01:15.0                         Foul: Shooting                                            DeMarre Carroll                                                  Terrence Jones            CC             Video

     Q4           00:58.6               Instant Replay: Support Ruling                                                                                                                                 CC             Video
Comment:        Referees communicated with the Replay Center to determine if the shot clock should be reset after Millsap's (ATL) FGA. The referees' decision that the ball did not hit
                the rim was upheld. Clocks adjusted accordingly.
     Q4           00:58.6                   Foul: Personal                                                     Trevor Ariza                                                 DeMarre Carroll            CC             Video
Comment:        Correct call on the foul. Question of timing for common foul (after release) vs away-from-play (before). Players may engage prior to an inbound pass, but a foul occurs when
                FOM is restricted. Carroll (ATL) is creating space when the ball is OOB. Then Ariza (HOU) affects his FOM as the pass is released. Correct call. However, we have reinforced the
                need to use replay when plays are close.
     Q4           00:51.7                         Foul: Personal                                            Patrick Beverley                                                  Paul Millsap             CC             Video
Comment:        Beverley (HOU) grabs the arm of Millsap (ATL), preventing him from catching the entry pass into the post.

     Q4           00:33.5                         Foul: Personal                                              Corey Brewer                                                    Jeff Teague              CC             Video
