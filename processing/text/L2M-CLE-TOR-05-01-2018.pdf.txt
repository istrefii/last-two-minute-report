Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

Comment:           Thompson (CLE) makes contact with Lowry (TOR) before he has gathered the ball, affecting his SQBR. On a drive to the rim that
                   will end in the Lower Defensive Box, contact must occur after the gather to be deemed a shooting foul.
     Q4            01:51.0           Foul: Personal                                          Kyle Korver                                     DeMar DeRozan              CNC         Video
Comment:           Korver (CLE) cleanly dislodges the ball away from DeRozan (TOR), and then maintains a legal guarding position in the corner.

Comment:           James (CLE) steps forward to contest Ibaka's (TOR) shot, and then turns, leaving his left foot in Ibaka's landing area.

     Q4            01:42.0          Instant Replay: Support Ruling                                                                                                       CC         Video
Comment:           After communicating with the Replay Center, James (CLE) is assessed a common foul. James is turning and not extending his
                   leg forward into Ibaka's (TOR) landing area.

                  01:42.1     To   01:32.0


     Q4            01:33.0          Foul: Shooting                                         Jonas Valanciunas                                  LeBron James              CNC         Video
Comment:           Valanciunas (TOR) maintains legal guarding position and makes incidental contact with James (CLE) that does not affect his drive
                   to the basket and shot attempt.

                  01:32.1                                                           01:11.0

Comment:           After Love (CLE) secures the rebound, DeRozan (TOR) makes contact with his arms and wraps him up. Love steps with the ball,
                   however when a violation (like a travel) and a foul occur at the same time, the foul will take precedence.
     Q4            01:11.0        Foul: Offensive                                             Kevin Love                                     DeMar DeRozan               IC         Video
Comment:           Love (CLE) swings his elbows and makes contact with DeRozan (TOR). Given the wind up and impact, the play should have been
                   reviewed and a Flagrant Foul Penalty 1 should have been assessed.

                  01:11.1                                                                                00:45.0

Comment:           Anunoby (TOR) establishes a wide screening position in Smith's (CLE) path, but contact occurs to Anunoby's torso area and not
                   his leg.
     Q4            00:54.3          Foul: Personal                                             LeBron James                                  DeMar DeRozan              CNC         Video

Comment:     Lowry (TOR) establishes a screening position in James's (CLE) path before contact, leaning forward and extending his arms,
             but collapses his arms and absorbs the contact from James.
    Q4       00:12.4           Foul: Personal                                             George Hill                                    DeMar DeRozan              CNC       Video
Comment:     Hill (CLE) keeps consistent hand contact on DeRozan (TOR) without affecting his SQBR. LHH shows that Hill's hand brushes
             DeRozan's loose jersey and he does not grab it.
    Q4       00:06.8          Foul: Loose Ball                                       Jonas Valanciunas                                  Tristan Thompson                      Video
Comment:     [Incidental or immaterial] Valanciunas (TOR) dislodges Thompson (CLE) while the ball is in the air and Thompson
             holds Valanciunas' jersey. Neither player makes an attempt for the rebound.
    Q4       00:04.1         Foul: Shooting                                       Tristan Thompson                                           CJ Miles               CNC       Video

Comment:     As Valanciunas (TOR) puts the ball back, James (CLE) initiates contact to his side. LATR and RATR show that James
             extends his arm slightly, but does not affect Valanciunas' shot attempt.
    Q4       00:00.6          Foul: Offensive                                          LeBron James                                         Kyle Lowry              CNC       Video

             his pivot foot on the floor until he releases his pass.
    Q5        01:36.0          Foul: Loose Ball                                         DeMar DeRozan                                   Tristan Thompson             INC      Video

             along the same path after the initial pick.
