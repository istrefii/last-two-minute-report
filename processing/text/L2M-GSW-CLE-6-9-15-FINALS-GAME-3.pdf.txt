Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during overtime,
where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the outcome of a
possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch, zoom or other
technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are denoted with an *. The league may change an opinion after further review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If
you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

     Q4           01:31.0                         Foul: Offensive                                                David Lee                                                Matthew Dellavedova         CNC             Video
Comment:        Lee (GSW) sets a screen on Dellavedova (CLE) and gives him the opportunity to stop and/or change direction.

     Q4           01:27.0                         Foul: Offensive                                                David Lee                                                Matthew Dellavedova         CNC             Video

Comment:        James (CLE) cleanly strips the ball from Curry (GSW) before contact is made. The contact made after the strip is incidental to the players' attempt to retrieve the ball.

     Q4           00:55.4                        Foul: Loose Ball                                                David Lee                                                Matthew Dellavedova         CNC             Video

Comment:        RATR shows that Lee (GSW) gets into a legal screening position before the contact with Shumpert (CLE), but then grabs his leg and prevents him from recovering on
                defense.
     Q4           00:21.7                         Foul: Offensive                                           Draymond Green                                                 Tristan Thompson           CNC             Video
Comment:        Green (GSW) sets the screen on Thompson (CLE) and gives him the opportunity to stop and/or change direction.

     Q4           00:20.3                         Foul: Shooting                                            Timofey Mozgov                                                   Stephen Curry            CNC             Video

Comment:        After communicating with the Replay Center, the ruling that GSW be awarded the ball was overturned. Replay showed that Dellavedova (CLE) was inbounds and
                had possession when Thompson (GSW) made contact with the ball from OOBs. When the ball becomes OOBs because it is touching a player who is on or outside a
                boundary, such player is deemed to have caused it to go out. Possession by the player OOBs is not necessary.

Comment:        Barnes (GSW) commits a take foul on James (CLE).

     Q4           00:15.5                         Foul: Offensive                                                David Lee                                                Matthew Dellavedova         CNC             Video
