Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

Comment:           LHH shows LeVert (BKN) cleanly deflects the ball away from Howard (CHA), who then regathers possession. Allen (BKN) reaches
                   in and makes clean contact with the ball and Howard extends his off-arm into his face and initiates the contact.

Comment:           Acy (BKN) sets the screen on Lamb (CHA) and gives him room to avoid the contact.


                  01:39.1                                                   01:19.0

     Q4            01:25.0          Foul: Shooting                                          Allen Crabbe                                   Kemba Walker                CNC          Video
Comment:           RO SLA shows that Crabbe (BKN) is in a legal guarding position and Walker (CHA) unnaturally kicks his legs behind him to create
                   the contact.

                  01:19.1                                                                              00:57.7

Comment:           LATR shows that Kaminsky (CHA) legally contests Carroll's (BKN) jump shot attempt and allows him to land. Any contact to the
                   body is deemed incidental.
