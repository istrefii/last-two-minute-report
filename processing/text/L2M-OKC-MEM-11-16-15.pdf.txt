Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

                                                                             (CC = Correct Call, IC = Incorrect Call, CNC = Correct Non-Call, INC = Incorrect Non-Call)

     Q4           01:44.0                         Foul: Personal                                                Tony Allen                                                 Russell Westbrook          CNC             Video
Comment:         Allen (MEM) maintains legal guarding position and Westbrook (OKC) falls to the ground.
     Q4           01:41.0                      Turnover: Traveling                                         Russell Westbrook                                                                          CNC             Video
Comment:         A player who falls and slides with the ball only travels if he gains an advantage. Here, with little defensive pressure, Westbrook (OKC) gains no advantage by sliding and
                 calls a timeout anyway. RHH shows trip is self-inflicted.
     Q4           01:10.0               Instant Replay: Support Ruling                                                                                                                                 CC             Video
Comment:         After communicating with the Replay Center, the ruling on the court that Conley's (MEM) field goal was a 3 point attempt was upheld.
     Q4           00:38.4                         Foul: Personal                                                Tony Allen                                                 Russell Westbrook           CC             Video
Comment:         Allen (MEM) makes contact to Westbrook's (OKC) body that causes him to fall to the ground when he reaches in for the steal.
     Q4           00:37.9                         Foul: Personal                                           Russell Westbrook                                                  Marc Gasol              INC             Video
Comment:         Westbrook (OKC) makes contact with Gasol's (MEM) wrist and causes him to lose control of the ball.
     Q4           00:34.8                         Foul: Personal                                           Russell Westbrook                                                Mario Chalmers             CC             Video
Comment:         Westbrook (OKC) commits a take foul on Chalmers (MIA).
     Q4           00:32.0                         Foul: Offensive                                          Russell Westbrook                                                  Marc Gasol              INC             Video
Comment:         Westbrook (OKC) kicks his leg into Gasol (MEM) on his shot. An offensive player commits a foul when he seeks contact with an airborne defender in a legal guarding
                 position if the contact is not incidental to the shot, as here, and/or he dislodges the defender.
     Q4           00:27.1                         Foul: Personal                                              Steven Adams                                                     Jeff Green              CC             Video
Comment:         Adams (OKC) commits a take foul on Green (MEM).
     Q4           00:19.4                         Foul: Personal                                              Steven Adams                                                  Mario Chalmers             CC             Video
Comment:         Adams (OKC) commits a take foul on Chalmers (MEM).
     Q4           00:16.3                      Turnover: Traveling                                         Russell Westbrook                                                                          CNC             Video
Comment:         Westbrook (OKC) plants and establishes his left foot as his pivot foot as he gathers the ball. He then raises his pivot foot off the floor, but passes prior to returning the pivot
                 foot to the floor, which is legal.
