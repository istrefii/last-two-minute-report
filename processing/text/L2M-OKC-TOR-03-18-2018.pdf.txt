Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

Comment:           Adams (OKC) sets the screen on Wright (TOR) and gives him room to avoid the contact.

     Q4            01:56.0          Foul: Offensive                                          Steven Adams                                         Delon Wright           CNC        Video

     Q4            01:44.0          Foul: Offensive                                          DeMar DeRozan                                    Corey Brewer               CNC        Video
Comment:           DeRozan (TOR) starts his drive as Brewer (OKC) is retreating and there is contact. The contact is incidental as both players
                   attempt to perform normal basketball moves.
     Q4            01:41.0         Foul: Shooting                                             Corey Brewer                                   DeMar DeRozan                CC        Video
Comment:           RATR shows Brewer (OKC) does not beat DeRozan (TOR) to the spot and he is not in a legal guarding position at the time of the

                  01:41.1                                                          01:20.0

Comment:           Ibaka (TOR) maintains legal guarding position and cleanly deflects the ball away from George (OKC).

Comment:           Brewer (OKC) is in a legal guarding position and absorbs the contact from DeRozan (TOR), who loses control of the ball.

Comment:           Ibaka (TOR) has his arm wrapped around Adams (OKC) and he dislodges him during rebounding.

     Q4            01:09.0          Foul: Shooting                                           Pascal Siakam                                        Paul George             CC        Video

Comment:     Ibaka (TOR) is in a legal guarding position and makes incidental contact with Westbrook (OKC) that does not affect his drive to
             the basket and shot attempt.

             00:39.8                 00:29.3

Comment:     RHH shows Brewer (OKC) make contact with the ball and the part of DeRozan's (TOR) hand that is on the ball. The hand is
             considered "part of the ball" when it is in contact with the ball and therefore, contact on that part of the hand by a defender
             while it is in contact with the ball is not illegal.

             00:29.4                                                00:12.3

Comment:     Ibaka (TOR) legally contests Westbrook's (OKC) jump shot attempt. Any "high-five" contact after the release is considered
             incidental.
