Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         Love (CLE) receives the pass inside the lower defensive box (the area between the 3-foot posted-up marks, the bottom tip of the circle and the endline) and therefore
                 Antetokounmpo (MIL) may be in the restricted area when he attempts to block Love's shot.
     Q4           01:24.0                         Foul: Offensive                                            Khris Middleton                                                 Richard Jefferson            CC             Video

Comment:         LHH shows Jefferson (CLE) attempt to clamp Monroe's (MIL) arm under the basket prior to the rebound attempt. Monroe lets his arm go and Jefferson continues to slide

Comment:         Antetokounmpo (MIL) places two hands on James (CLE) on his drive. When a player drives, the defensive player may place an extended forearm to the side of the driving
                 player.

Comment:         CLE asst coaches and bench players called for a TO. While officiating oncourt play, Referee heard a TO called and stopped play. Only the head coach and oncourt
                 players can be granted a TO and stoppage deemed an inadvertent whistle. CLE then requests a TO.
