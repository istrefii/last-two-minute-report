Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

Comment:           Cauley-Stein (SAC) sets the screen on Teague (MIN) and gives him room to avoid the contact.

     Q4            01:32.0          Foul: Shooting                                            Taj Gibson                                   Willie Cauley-Stein            CC        Video
Comment:           Gibson (MIN) makes contact with Cauley-Stein's (SAC) arm that affects his shot attempt near the rim.

Comment:           Towns (MIN) dribbles then fumbles the ball. Since he moves his pivot foot slightly to recover the ball, he may only pass or shoot.
                   He passes and remains legal.

                   to the basket and shot attempt.

Comment:             Bogdanovic (SAC) moves along Butler's (MIN) path as he defends him up the court. Both players are performing normal
                     basketball moves and contact is deemed incidental.

Comment:             [Incidental or immaterial] Gibson (MIN) establishes a screen on Bogdanovic (SAC) out of his field of vision, and should therefore
                     give him a step toward him. However, when contact occurs, the defenders have already switched.
      Q4             00:24.8           Foul: Defense 3 Second                           Willie Cauley-Stein                                                                     INC      Video

Comment:             LHH shows Bogdanovic (SAC) makes contact with Butler's (MIN) arm and affects his ability to control the ball.

      Q4             00:19.9           Foul: Loose Ball                                           Taj Gibson                                   Zach Randolph                   CNC       Video

Comment:             Butler (MIN) legally contests Fox's (SAC) jump shot attempt. Any "high-five" contact after the release is considered incidental.

Comment:             Cauley-Stein (SAC) dislodges Wiggins (MIN), affecting his ability to retrieve the rebound.
