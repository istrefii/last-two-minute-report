Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

                                                                             (CC = Correct Call, IC = Incorrect Call, CNC = Correct Non-Call, INC = Incorrect Non-Call)

     Q4           01:44.0                         Foul: Shooting                                               Tim Duncan                                                     Eric Gordon             CNC             Video
Comment:         Duncan (SAS) maintains legal guarding position as Gordon (NOP) drives to the basket and through his shot attempt.
     Q4           01:31.0                    Foul: Defense 3 Second                                           Anthony Davis                                                                           CNC             Video
Comment:         LATR shows Davis (NOP) enters the paint and begins to imminently become legal under three seconds as he moves toward the edge of the paint. He continues without
                 stopping until he has fully cleared.
     Q4           01:17.0                         Foul: Offensive                                           Kendrick Perkins                                                  Danny Green             CNC             Video
Comment:         Perkins (NOP) and Davis (NOP) set the screen on Green (SAS) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           00:36.4                         Foul: Shooting                                            Kendrick Perkins                                                 Kawhi Leonard            CNC             Video
Comment:         Perkins (NOP) makes incidental body contact with Leonard (SAS) after he releases the ball, and is therefore finished with his shooting motion on the jump shot. Perkins
                 comes straight down and does not move under Leonard.
     Q4           00:30.8                         Foul: Shooting                                               Tim Duncan                                                     Jrue Holiday            CNC             Video
Comment:         Duncan (SAS) maintains legal guarding position and makes incidental contact with Holiday (NOP) that does not affect his drive to the basket and shot attempt.
     Q4           00:09.4                         Foul: Shooting                                          Dante Cunningham                                                   Kawhi Leonard            CNC             Video
Comment:         Cunningham (NOP) legally contests Leonard's (SAS) jump shot attempt. Any "high-five" contact after the release is considered incidental.
