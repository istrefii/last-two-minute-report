Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         R-SLA shows that after Hill (IND) cleanly strips the ball , Harden (HOU) grabs Hill affecting his ability to retrieve the loose ball.
     Q4           01:20.0                         Foul: Shooting                                               Paul George                                                  Patrick Beverley          CNC             Video
Comment:         LHH shows that George (IND) maintains legal guarding position and legally contests Beverley's (HOU) layup attempt. After making contact with the ball, George makes
                 incidental contact with Beverley's arm that does not affect the layup attempt.

Comment:         Beverley (HOU) clamps Hill's (IND) arm, affecting his ability to retrieve the rebound.
     Q4           00:23.3               Instant Replay: Overturn Ruling                                                                                                                                CC             Video

                 The ruling on the court was overturned, and Houston was awarded possession.
     Q4           00:23.3                         Foul: Offensive                                             James Harden                                                    Paul George             CNC             Video

Comment:         Hill (IND) is correctly called for the foul as he makes contact with Harden's (HOU) arm on the drive and shot attempt. However, this should be ruled a shooting foul.
