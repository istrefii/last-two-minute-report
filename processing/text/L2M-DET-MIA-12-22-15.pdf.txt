Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

     Q4           01:45.0                         Foul: Shooting                                           Andre Drummond                                                      Dwyane Wade                 IC             Video
Comment:         Wade (MIA) leads with an unnatural extended leg into the mid-section of Drummond (DET). This contact trumps any contact by Drummond that affects the shot attempt
                 and an offensive foul should be called.

Comment:         Drummond (DET) sets the screen on Udrih (MIA) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           01:00.0                      Turnover: Traveling                                           Reggie Jackson                                                                               CNC             Video
Comment:         RHH shows that Jackson (DET) ends his dribble on his left foot and takes two legal steps prior to releasing his pass.
     Q4           00:35.8                         Foul: Personal                                            Anthony Tolliver                                                     Chris Bosh               CNC             Video

Comment:         Udrih (MIA) allows Jackson (DET) to land after he attempts the jump shot. Any contact following the landing is incidental.

     Q4           00:01.1                         Foul: Offensive                                            Dwyane Wade                                                  Kentavious Caldwell-Pope        CNC             Video
