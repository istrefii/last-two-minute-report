Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

                                                                             (CC = Correct Call, IC = Incorrect Call, CNC = Correct Non-Call, INC = Incorrect Non-Call)

     Q4           01:56.0                         Foul: Offensive                                              Serge Ibaka                                                 Luc Mbah a Moute           CNC             Video
Comment:         Ibaka (OKC) sets the screen on Mbah a Moute (LAC) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           01:30.0                         Foul: Offensive                                          Russell Westbrook                                                  Blake Griffin           CNC             Video
Comment:         Griffin (LAC) maintains legal guarding position as he contests Westbrook's (OKC) layup attempt. Westbrook does not kick his leg out unnaturally and the contact by his
                 foot to Griffin is considered incidental and part of a normal basketball play.
     Q4           01:12.0                         Foul: Offensive                                           DeAndre Jordan                                                    Kevin Durant            CNC             Video

Comment:         RHH shows that Adams (OKC) makes body to body contact that affects Paul's (LAC) RSBQ as he attempts to split the trap. As a result of the body contact, Paul makes
                 incidental contact with Adams' face.
     Q4           01:04.0                         Foul: Personal                                              Dion Waiters                                                      JJ Redick             INC             Video
Comment:         LATR and L-SLASH shows Waiters (OKC) grabs and pulls Redick's (LAC) jersey slightly, affecting his FOM away from the ball as he goes around the screen. The jersey pull
                 takes place before Redick catches, plants and takes the shot.
     Q4           00:41.4                         Foul: Offensive                                              Blake Griffin                                                  Dion Waiters            CNC             Video
Comment:         Griffin (LAC) firms up as he sets the screen on Waiters (OKC) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           00:32.6                         Foul: Offensive                                             Steven Adams                                                     Chris Paul             CNC             Video

Comment:         Roberson (OKC) maintains legal guarding position and does not affect Redick's (LAC) RSBQ on the drive to the basket.
     Q4           00:16.1                      Turnover: Traveling                                               JJ Redick                                                                            CNC             Video
Comment:         Redick (LAC) gathers and legally takes a step with his left foot and then right foot. The ball is then stripped when he pivots.
     Q4           00:15.5                         Foul: Personal                                           Russell Westbrook                                                    JJ Redick             CNC             Video

Comment:         L-SLASH shows that as he falls to the ground, Westbrook (OKC) undercuts Paul (LAC) and makes contact with his left leg that affects his movement to the basket on the
                 made layup attempt.
     Q4           00:10.9                         Foul: Offensive                                              Serge Ibaka                                                 Luc Mbah a Moute           INC             Video
