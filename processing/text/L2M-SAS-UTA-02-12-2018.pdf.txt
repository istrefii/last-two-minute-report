Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

Comment:           Favors (UTA) establishes a screening position in Murray's (SAS) path, but readjusts his position and does not give Murray a

Comment:             Gasol (SAS) establishes a screening position on O'Neale (UTA) and is firming up when O'Neale passes, with almost no contact to
                     his body. Once O'Neale has passed, Gasol is legally in his path.

                     redirects it inbounds before he steps out of bounds with his right foot.
