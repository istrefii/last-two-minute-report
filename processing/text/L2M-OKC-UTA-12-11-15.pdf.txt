Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

     Q4           01:36.0                         Foul: Personal                                              Trevor Booker                                                Russell Westbrook          CNC             Video
Comment:         LATR shows that Booker (UTA) and Burke (UTA) maintain legal guarding position as they defend Westbrook's (OKC) drive into the paint. Westbrook trips, but not as a
                 result of any contact.

Comment:         Adams (OKC) and Hayward (UTA) briefly engage and separate during rebounding. However, as Adams jumps for the rebound, Hood (UTA) comes over his back and
                 dislodges him, affecting his ability to retrieve the rebound.
     Q4           00:03.3                         Foul: Personal                                            Gordon Hayward                                                    Kevin Durant             CC             Video
