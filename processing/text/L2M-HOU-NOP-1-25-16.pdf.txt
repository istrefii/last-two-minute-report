Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         After communicating with the Replay Center, there was conclusive video evidence that showed that the ball was last touched by Ariza (HOU) prior to going OOB. The ruling
                 on the court was overturned and New Orleans was awarded possession.

Comment:         Holiday (NOP) makes incidental contact that does not affect Harden's (HOU) RSBQ. After the contact Holiday trips over his own foot causing him to fall to the ground.

Comment:         Smith (HOU) maintains legal guarding position and legally contests Anderson's (NOP) jump shot attempt. Any "high-five" contact after the release is considered incidental.
