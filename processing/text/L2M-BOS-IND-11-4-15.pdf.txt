Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         Hill (IND) sets the screen on Thomas (BOS) and gives him the opportunity to avoid the contact.
     Q4           01:41.0               Instant Replay: Support Ruling                                                                                                                                 CC             Video
Comment:         After communicating with the Replay Center, the ruling on the court that the shot by Thomas (BOS) was a three-point field goal was upheld.
     Q4           01:08.0                         Foul: Offensive                                                David Lee                                                    Paul George             CNC             Video
Comment:         Lee (BOS) sets the screen on George (IND) prior to rolling to the basket and gives him the opportunity to avoid the contact.
     Q4           00:36.0                         Foul: Offensive                                                David Lee                                                    George Hill             CNC             Video
Comment:         Lee (BOS) sets the screen on Hill (IND) and gives him the opportunity to avoid the contact.
     Q4           00:13.7                         Foul: Personal                                              Avery Bradley                                                   Monta Ellis              CC             Video
Comment:         Bradley (BOS) does not obtain a legal guarding position and makes contact with Ellis (IND), affecting his FOM as he begins his drive to the basket. Since Ellis loses control
                 of the ball, a non-shooting foul is correctly called.
     Q4           00:08.4                         Foul: Personal                                                George Hill                                                  Isaiah Thomas            CNC             Video
Comment:         Hill (IND) maintains legal guarding position as Thomas (BOS) initiates the contact when he begins his drive to the basket.
     Q4           00:06.6                         Foul: Personal                                                Jordan Hill                                                  Isaiah Thomas            CNC             Video
Comment:         George Hill (IND - 3) maintains a legal guarding position as he defends Thomas' (BOS) drive to the basket. Thomas then steps on Jordan Hill's (IND - 27) foot and falls to
                 the floor.
     Q4           00:00.1                         Foul: Personal                                             Jared Sullinger                                                  Lavoy Allen             CNC             Video
