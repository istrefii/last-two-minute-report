Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

     Q4           01:53.0                         Foul: Offensive                                              Brook Lopez                                                   LeBron James              IC             Video
Comment:         LHH and LATR show James (CLE) applies a forearm with a bent elbow to Lopez (BKN) in the lower defensive box, which is legal. James then
                 hooks Lopez’s arm from underneath and Lopez reacts by clamping James’ arm with his left off arm / hand and a double foul should be called.
                 However, the slot sees only Lopez’s action and calls an offensive foul The lead referee has a dual whistle at this point, seeing the two players
                 arms wrapped up. On plays in the paint, all three referees have responsibility to help with contact, and when two or three referees make a
                 call, they are trained to make eye contact and the official who takes control of the play tweets multiple whistles to indicate he has the play. In
                 this case, the referee who thought he had the best look was incorrect based on the angles available. We should have a double foul with BKN
                 retaining possession.
