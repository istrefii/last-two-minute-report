Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during overtime,
where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the outcome of a
possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch, zoom or other
technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are denoted with an *. The league may change an opinion after further review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If
you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

                                                                             (CC = Correct Call, IC = Incorrect Call, CNC = Correct Non-Call, INC = Incorrect Non-Call)

     Q4           01:56.0                         Foul: Offensive                                          Jonas Valanciunas                                                 LeBron James             CNC             Video
Comment:        Valanciunas (TOR) sets a screen on James (CLE) and gives him the opportunity to stop and/or change direction.

     Q4           01:30.0                         Foul: Personal                                               Lou Williams                                                   Kyrie Irving             CC             Video
Comment:        Williams (TOR) does not beat Irving (CLE) to the spot as he tries to cut off the drive to the basket. The foul occurs before Irving's shooting motion starts and therefore
                a common foul.

     Q4           00:29.1                  Stoppage: Out-of-Bounds                                                                                                                                     CC             Video
Comment:        Ball is correctly awarded to TOR.

Comment:        Vasquez (TOR) commits a take foul on Irving (CLE).

     Q4           00:20.6                         Foul: Personal                                               Lou Williams                                                  LeBron James              CC             Video
Comment:        Williams (TOR) commits a take foul on James (CLE).

     Q4           00:13.2                         Foul: Shooting                                                Kyrie Irving                                                Greivis Vasquez           CNC             Video
