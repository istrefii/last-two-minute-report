Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         Leonard (SAS) cleanly blocks McCollum's (POR) shot attempt from behind.
     Q4           01:06.0                         Foul: Personal                                              Danny Green                                                    Damian Lillard                           Video
Comment:         [Observable in production angle] LHH shows Green (SAS) make contact with Lillard's (POR) arm on his drive before he starts his upward shooting motion.
     Q4           01:05.0                         Foul: Shooting                                              Kyle Anderson                                                  Damian Lillard           CNC             Video
Comment:         LATR and LHH show Anderson (SAS) cleanly blocks Lillard's (POR) layup attempt. Any contact made with his Lillard's hand is legal as it is considered part of the ball when
                 contact is made.
