Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during overtime,
where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the outcome of a
possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch, zoom or other
technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further review, particularly when a
new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         [Detectable with stop watch] Jordan (LAC) is in the lane without actively guarding for about 4 secs when he is imminently clearing. Holiday's (OKC) drive
                 complicates the play since, had he drove straight and Jordan picked him up, Jordan would have been iminently legal at the start of his drive.
