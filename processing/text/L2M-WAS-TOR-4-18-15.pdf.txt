Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during overtime,
where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the outcome of a
possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch, zoom or other
technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are denoted with an *. The league may change an opinion after further review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If
you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:        Vasquez (TOR) makes body to body contact with Beal (WAS) that affects his ability to drive on the baseline.

     Q5           01:12.0               Turnover: 24 Second Violation                                                 ,                                                                               INC             Video
Comment:        A 24 Second violation should be called as the ball is still loose when the shot clock expires.

     Q5           01:09.0                         Foul: Personal                                                Paul Pierce                                                 Greivis Vasquez            CC             Video
Comment:        Pierce (WAS) grabs Vasquez (TOR) to foul. The IR review determined that, while Pierce came to Vasquez from the side, he could have obtained a position between the
                ball and the basket had the play continued and therefore the foul was not a clear path foul.
     Q5          01:09.0             Instant Replay: Support Ruling                            Paul Pierce                                                                                             CC             Video
Comment:        After communicating with the Replay Center, the officials determined that the foul committed by Pierce (WAS) did not meet the criteria for a clear path foul.

     Q5           01:04.0                         Foul: Shooting                                                Paul Pierce                                                  Amir Johnson             INC*            Video
Comment:        Pierce (WAS) jumps vertically to defend Johnson's (TOR) layup, but then lowers his arms. If his arms had come down and no contact made, the play would have been
                legal. Angle above the rim shows contact and therefore the foul should have been called.
     Q5           00:39.7                    Foul: Personal                                  Amir Johnson                                                                      John Wall              INC             Video
Comment:        Johnson (TOR) makes contact with Wall (WAS) to commit the take foul after being beaten off the dribble but no foul is called.

Comment:        Pierce (WAS) makes contact with the inbounds pass in the frontcourt prior to gaining possession in the backcourt. Backcourt rules allow for the ball to be thrown into
                the backcourt on an inbound during the last two minutes of the game.
     Q5           00:16.0                  Foul: Personal                                                    Greivis Vasquez                                                  Bradley Beal             CC             Video
Comment:        Vasquez (TOR) commits a take foul on Beal (WAS).

Comment:        DeRozan (TOR) commits a take foul on Pierce (WAS).
