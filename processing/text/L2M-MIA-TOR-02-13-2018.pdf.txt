Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

Comment:           Richardson (MIA) makes marginal contact with DeRozan (TOR) and disengages.


                  01:59.1                                                   01:39.0

Comment:           Richardson (MIA) maintains a legal guarding position on DeRozan's (TOR) drive and shot attempt. Any "high-five" contact after
                   the release is considered incidental.

Comment:           R-Slash shows Lowry (TOR) makes contact with the ball and deflects it out of Dragic's (MIA) hand.


                  01:28.1                                                                       01:03.0

Comment:           Valanciunas (TOR) sets the screen on Ellington (MIA) and gives him room to avoid the contact.

     Q4            01:10.0          Foul: Personal                                         Bam Adebayo                                     Jonas Valanciunas           CNC          Video

Comment:           Johnson (MIA) legally contests Lowry's (TOR) jump shot attempt. Any "high-five" contact after the release is considered incidental.


                  01:03.1                                     00:56.9

Comment:           Adebayo (MIA) establishes a wide screening position in VanVleet's (TOR) path and contact occurs to his leg.


                  00:57.0                                     00:41.1

     Q4            00:45.7          Foul: Offensive                                          Kyle Lowry                                    Josh Richardson             CNC          Video
Comment:           Lowry (TOR) establishes a legal screening position in Richardson's (MIA) path. Since Richardson is stationary when Lowry
                   establishes his position, Lowry does not need to give him room to avoid the screen (he may not initiate the contact).
     Q4            00:41.1           Foul: Shooting                                        Tyler Johnson                                   DeMar DeRozan                CC          Video
Comment:           Johnson (MIA) makes contact with DeRozan (TOR) that affects his driving shot attempt.

Comment:             Ellington (MIA) initially establishes a wide screening position in VanVleet's (TOR) path, but firms up over his leg and absorbs
                     contact to his shoulder/chest area. VanVleet briefly hooks Ellington's arm as he goes around, and then falls on his own accord.
      Q4             00:34.7          Foul: Shooting                                     Jonas Valanciunas                               Goran Dragic                          CNC       Video
Comment:             Valanciunas (TOR) maintains legal guarding position during Dragic's (MIA) jump shot and contact occurs after he has released the
                     ball.
      Q4             00:30.7           Foul: Personal                                          Dwyane Wade                                     Pascal Siakam                   CNC       Video
Comment:             Wade (MIA) performs a normal basketball move and does not affect Siakam's (TOR) ability to pass. Contact is incidental.

Comment:             Valanciunas (TOR) and Adebayo (MIA) briefly engage and separate while attempting to rebound.

      Q4             00:23.8           Foul: Personal                                            Kyle Lowry                                    Dwyane Wade                     CNC       Video

Comment:             Dragic (MIA) maintains a legal guarding position as DeRozan (TOR) wraps the ball near the baseline.


                    00:14.3

Comment:             Adebayo (MIA) initiates contact with DeRozan (TOR) that causes him to step on the baseline and out of bounds. The
                     out-of-bounds call preceded the call for a timeout.

Comment:             Dragic (MIA) and VanVleet (TOR) engage after the ball is inbounded.


                    00:06.9
                    00:06.9    To    00:02.8
