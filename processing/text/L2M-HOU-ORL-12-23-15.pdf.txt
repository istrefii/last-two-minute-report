Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during overtime,
where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the outcome of a
possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch, zoom or other
technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further review, particularly when a
new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         RHH and RATR show Lawson (HOU) extends his hip into Harris (ORL) as he sets the hand-off screen, and doesn't give him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           01:15.0                         Foul: Shooting                                             Dwight Howard                                                    Elfrid Payton           CNC             Video

     Q4           01:07.0                         Foul: Offensive                                             James Harden                                                   Victor Oladipo           CNC             Video
Comment:         Harden (HOU) steps toward Oladipo (ORL) as he is retreating and extends his arm to gain space. Oladipo's movement backwards does not appear to be
                 commensurate with the level of contact.

Comment:         Howard (HOU) and Payton (ORL) have simultaneous possession of the ball and a jump ball is correctly called.
     Q4           00:26.9                         Foul: Shooting                                              Evan Fournier                                                 Patrick Beverley           CC             Video

Comment:         LHH shows Beverley (HOU) maintains a legal guarding position during Fournier's (ORL) drive; Beverley is permitted to apply a forearm to Fournier in the LBD to
                 maintain his defensive position and he does not affect his RSBQ on the drive.

      Q4          00:01.1                         Foul: Personal                                                Ty Lawson                                                     Tobias Harris            CC             Video
Comment:         Lawson (HOU) commits a take foul on Harris (ORL). Since the foul occurs before the touch, no time is taken off the clock (time is put back on during free throws).

     Q4           00:01.1                         Foul: Personal                                              Victor Oladipo                                                 James Harden             CNC             Video
