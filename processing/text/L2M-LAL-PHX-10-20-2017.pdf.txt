Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the
last two-minutes of the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will
generally be defined as material plays directly related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video
evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on
contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the
explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly      officiated. The league may change its view after further review. If you have any questions, please contact the
                                                             here.
