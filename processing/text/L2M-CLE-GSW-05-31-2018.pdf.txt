Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

Comment:           LATR shows that Looney (GSW) jumps from point A to point B and makes contact to James' (CLE) body that affects his play at the
                   basket.

Comment:           The crew was not reasonably certain whether James (CLE) was in the restricted area after an offensive foul was called against
                   Durant (GSW). Upon replay review, it was confirmed that James was outside the restricted area. The referees also reviewed
                   whether James was in a legal guarding position, which is an additional reviewable matter for this replay trigger. Replay showed
                   James was not in a legal guarding position because he was turning his body and moving into Durant when contact occurred.
                   Thus the initial call on the floor was overturned and James was assessed a blocking foul.
