Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

Comment:             Crabbe (BKN) gathers the ball on his right foot and then steps with his left to come to a stop and establish a pivot foot. He
                     pivots on his left toe without lifting it from the floor. A very slight slide of his foot is only detectable using enhanced video but
                     the main focus of the travel (that he appears to move his pivot foot from the side of the free throw circle into the paint) is legal.
      Q4             00:20.9            Turnover: 3 Second Violation                              DeMarre Carroll                                                                        Video

Comment:             LHH shows Gibson (MIN) makes contact to Dinwiddie's (BKN) arm, and the contact occurs as Dinwiddie is starting his upward
                     shooting motion.




      Q4             00:02.0            Foul: Shooting                                            DeMarre Carroll                                    Jimmy Butler              CNC       Video
Comment:             Carroll (BKN) legally contests Butler's (MIN) jump shot attempt. Any "high-five" contact after the release is considered incidental.
