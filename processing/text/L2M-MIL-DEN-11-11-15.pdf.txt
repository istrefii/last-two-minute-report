Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

                                                                             (CC = Correct Call, IC = Incorrect Call, CNC = Correct Non-Call, INC = Incorrect Non-Call)

     Q4           01:40.0                         Foul: Shooting                                            Johnny O'Bryant                                                     JJ Hickson             CNC             Video
 Comment:        O'Bryant (MIL) legally contests Hickson's (DEN) layup attempt. Any contact that occurs is incidental and after the ball has been released.
     Q4           01:25.0                      Turnover: Traveling                                            Jerryd Bayless                                                                                           Video
 Comment:        [Observable in enhanced video] Bayless (MIL) switches his pivot foot before releasing the pass.
     Q4           01:18.0                         Foul: Offensive                                               JJ Hickson                                                    Jerryd Bayless            CC             Video
 Comment:        Hickson (DEN) sets the screen on Bayless (MIL) without giving him the room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           01:07.0                         Foul: Personal                                             Kenneth Faried                                                   Greg Monroe              INC             Video
 Comment:        Faried (DEN) affects Monroe's (MIL) FOM as he cuts away from the ball.
     Q4           00:47.1                         Foul: Personal                                              Jerryd Bayless                                                Emmanuel Mudiay             IC             Video
 Comment:        Bayless (MIL) has little contact with Mudiay (DEN), who trips on Faried (DEN). CC was on Faried, who is not in a legal screening position when Bayless hits his leg. If a
                 player uses a wide screen stance, contact must be absorbed in his upper body.
     Q4           00:40.0                         Foul: Offensive                                             Greg Monroe                                                    Danilo Gallinari          CNC             Video
 Comment:        Monroe (MIL) sets the screen on Gallinari (DEN) and gives him the room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           00:27.5                         Foul: Shooting                                            Johnny O'Bryant                                                 Emmanuel Mudiay             CC             Video
 Comment:        O'Bryant (MIL) makes contact with Mudiay's (DEN) arm that affects his drive to the basket and layup attempt.
     Q4           00:25.3                         Foul: Personal                                             Danilo Gallinari                                             Giannis Antetokounmpo                        Video
 Comment:        [Incidental or immaterial] Gallinari (DEN) makes incidental contact with Antetokounmpo (MIL) away from the ball.
     Q4           00:19.7                         Foul: Shooting                                             Kenneth Faried                                               Giannis Antetokounmpo        CNC             Video
 Comment:        Faried (DEN) jumps vertically and legally contests Antetokounmpo's (MIL) driving layup attempt.
