Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         Aminu (POR) dislodges Garnett (MIN) and affects his ability to secure the rebound.
     Q4           01:44.0                         Foul: Personal                                               CJ McCollum                                                    Kevin Martin             CC             Video
Comment:         McCollum (POR) makes body-to-body contact with Martin (MIN) on the perimeter that affects his FOM.
     Q4           01:12.0                      Turnover: Traveling                                             CJ McCollum                                                                            INC             Video
Comment:         McCollum (POR) gathers when landing on his L-foot (pivot), then splits his feet at the start of the dribble (Travel).
     Q4           01:11.0                         Foul: Personal                                               Kevin Martin                                                   CJ McCollum                             Video
Comment:         [Observable in production angle] RATR Martin (MIN) attempts to defend McCollum (POR) from a position where he does not have a reasonable chance to defend without
                 making contact. The responsibility is on the defender in this position.
     Q4           01:10.0                      Turnover: Traveling                                             CJ McCollum                                                                                            Video
Comment:         When ending his dribble, McCollum gathers on his R-foot (pivot), turns on this pivot, and jumps to shoot. He is legal because the ball is released before he lands.
     Q4           00:57.4                      Turnover: Traveling                                        Karl-Anthony Towns                                                                          CNC             Video
Comment:         Towns (MIN) gathers the ball in the air, lands on his left foot, plants his right foot and then jumps to shoot.
     Q4           00:54.4               Instant Replay: Support Ruling                                      Andrew Wiggins                                                                                            Video
Comment:         [Observable in enhanced video] After communicating with the Replay Center, the OBI ruling stood because there was no conclusive angle to show the ball was (or was not)
                 in the cylinder when it was touched.
     Q4           00:33.3                         Foul: Offensive                                            Mason Plumlee                                                  Andrew Wiggins            CNC             Video
Comment:         Plumlee (POR) sets the screen on Wiggins (MIN) and gives him the opportunity to avoid the contact.
     Q4           00:32.8                         Foul: Personal                                          Karl-Anthony Towns                                                  CJ McCollum             CNC             Video
Comment:         Towns (MIN) does not affect McCollum's (POR) RSBQ on the drive to the basket.
     Q4           00:29.7               Instant Replay: Overturn Ruling                                                                                                                                               Video
Comment:         [Observable in production angle] After communicating with the Replay Center, the initial ruling of a shot clock violation was overturned because it was determined that the
                 ball hit the rim on McCollum's (POR) layup. Jump ball at center circle because no possession at time of the whistle.
     Q4           00:16.6                         Foul: Shooting                                               CJ McCollum                                                  Andrew Wiggins            CNC             Video
Comment:         Wiggins (MIN) initiates the contact with McCollum (POR) who maintains legal guarding position while defending the shot attempt.
     Q4           00:12.3                        Foul: Loose Ball                                         Karl-Anthony Towns                                                 Mason Plumlee                            Video
Comment:         [Observable in enhanced video] Both Plumlee (POR) and Towns (MIN) grab one another during the jump ball. A double foul should be called.
     Q4           00:09.8                         Foul: Shooting                                               Allen Crabbe                                                   Kevin Martin                            Video
Comment:         [Observable in enhanced video] After multiple reviews from various angles, it is unclear whether Crabbe (POR) first makes contact with the ball (or hand as part of the ball)
                 and then Martin's (MIN) arm or his arm first.
