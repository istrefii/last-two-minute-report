Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         R-Slash shows that Beal (WAS) maintains legal guarding position as he defends Harden's (HOU) drive and step back shot attempt. The two players make incidental foot to
                 foot contact.

Comment:         RHH shows that Beverley (HOU) and Howard (HOU) maintain legal guarding position as they defend Wall's (WAS) drive to the basket. Any contact on the play is initiated
