Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         West (SAS) makes contact with Waiters's (OKC) arms during his driving shot attempt. Waiters has already gathered the ball when the foul occurs and takes a legal one,
                 two step and is correctly awarded continuation.
     Q4           00:16.2                         Foul: Offensive                                              David West                                                   Andre Roberson            CNC             Video

Comment:         Roberson (OKC) maintains legal guarding position as he defends Leonard's (SAS) drive and jump shot attempt. Any "high-five" contact after the release is considered

Comment:         Adams (OKC) and Marjanovic (SAS) briefly engage during rebounding, and the incidental contact as they transition upcourt causes Marjanovic to fall to the ground.
