Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during overtime,
where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the outcome of a
possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch, zoom or other
technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are denoted with an *. The league may change an opinion after further review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If
you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

                                                                             (CC = Correct Call, IC = Incorrect Call, CNC = Correct Non-Call, INC = Incorrect Non-Call)

     Q4           01:41.0                         Foul: Offensive                                             Derrick Favors                                                 Lance Thomas             CNC             Video
Comment:        Favors (UTA) is in a legal guarding position on the handoff. Thomas (NYK) runs into him while trying to chase his man over the screen.

     Q4           01:39.0                         Foul: Shooting                                           Langston Galloway                                                 Rodney Hood              CNC             Video
Comment:        RHH shows contact between Galloway (NYK) and Hood (UTA) is slight and does not affect Hood's RSBQ.

     Q4           01:26.0                         Foul: Shooting                                               Rudy Gobert                                                 Langston Galloway          CNC             Video
Comment:        Gobert (UTA) jumps vertically to contest Galloway's (NYK) layup attempt. Players must jump vertically and maintain their up and down trajectory. However, contact
                may turn the defender in the air.
     Q4          01:24.0                   Foul: Loose Ball                                                      Joe Ingles                                                   Cole Aldrich             CC             Video
Comment:        LO_SLA shows Ingles (UTA) makes contact with Aldrich's (NYK) wrist, which prevents him from controlling the rebound. A loose ball foul is assessed because Aldrich
                did not have possession.
     Q4           01:20.0                         Foul: Personal                                              Derrick Favors                                                Andrea Bargnani            CC             Video
Comment:        Favors (UTA) has his arm extended when Bargnani (NYK) attempts a "rip through." Since Bargnani is moving side-to-side, he is not considered to have started his
                upward shooting motion and a personal foul is assessed.
     Q4          01:05.0                  Foul: Shooting                                                      Alexey Shved                                                   Rodney Hood              CNC             Video
Comment:        Shved (NYK) cleanly blocks the shot attempt by Hood (UTA) .

     Q4           01:03.0                         Foul: Personal                                               Dante Exum                                                  Langston Galloway          CNC             Video
Comment:        Exum (UTA) cleanly knocks the ball away from Galloway (NYK) as he catches the outlet pass.

     Q4           01:01.0                      Turnover: Traveling                                               Joe Ingles                                                                           CNC             Video
Comment:        Ingles (UTA) does not have possession when he attempts to gain control of the ball and therefore he doesn't establish a pivot foot before he spins and passes.

     Q4           00:35.6                         Foul: Shooting                                              Derrick Favors                                                Andrea Bargnani           CNC             Video
Comment:        RHH shows Favors (UTA) maintains a legal guarding position as Bargnani(NYK) drives to basket. Bargnani makes space when Favors doesn't yield his defensive
                position.
     Q4           00:34.0                        Foul: Loose Ball                                              Rudy Gobert                                                    Cole Aldrich            CNC             Video
Comment:        Contact between Aldrich (NYK) and Gobert (UTA) is incidental in their attempt to gain the rebound.

     Q4           00:30.4                         Foul: Personal                                              Alexey Shved                                                     Trey Burke              CC             Video
Comment:        Shved (NYK) commits a take foul on Burke (UTA).

     Q4           00:26.6                         Foul: Shooting                                               Dante Exum                                                     Alexey Shved             CC             Video
Comment:        Exum (UTA) draws Shved (NYK) into the air and makes contact as he begins his upward shooting motion.

     Q4           00:26.1                         Foul: Personal                                              Alexey Shved                                                     Trey Burke              CC             Video
Comment:        Shved (NYK) commits a take foul on Burke (UTA).
