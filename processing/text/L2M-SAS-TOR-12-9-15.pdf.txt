Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

                                                                             (CC = Correct Call, IC = Incorrect Call, CNC = Correct Non-Call, INC = Incorrect Non-Call)

     Q4           01:42.0                         Foul: Personal                                               Cory Joseph                                                   Manu Ginobili             CC             Video
Comment:         Joseph (TOR) has his arms extended when Ginobili (SAS) "rips thru" and a personal foul is correctly called for the contact to the arm. Since the contact occurred on the side
                 to side motion it is not considered a shooting foul.
     Q4           01:24.0                         Foul: Shooting                                           LaMarcus Aldridge                                                DeMar DeRozan             CNC             Video
Comment:         Aldridge (SAS) establishes a legal guarding position and jumps vertically as he legally contests DeRozan's (TOR) driving shot attempt.
     Q4           00:50.2                         Foul: Personal                                             Kawhi Leonard                                                     Kyle Lowry             CNC             Video
Comment:         LATR shows that Leonard (SAS) cleanly strips the ball from Lowry (TOR) and that the contact by Parker (SAS) after the ball is loose is considered incidental.
     Q4           00:48.8               Instant Replay: Overturn Ruling                                                                                                                                CC             Video
Comment:         After communicating with the Replay Center, the ruling on the court that the ball was last touched by Leonard (SAS) was overturned. San Antonio was awarded
                 possession.
     Q4           00:43.1                         Foul: Offensive                                          LaMarcus Aldridge                                                Patrick Patterson         CNC             Video
Comment:         Aldridge (SAS) sets the screen on Patterson (TOR) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           00:38.5                         Foul: Shooting                                           Bismack Biyombo                                                 LaMarcus Aldridge          CNC             Video
Comment:         Biyombo (TOR) and Aldridge (SAS) make incidental contact with one another during rebounding that does not affect the putback dunk attempt.
     Q4           00:13.0                         Foul: Offensive                                          Bismack Biyombo                                                    Danny Green             CNC             Video
Comment:         Biyombo (TOR) firms up as he sets the screen on Green (SAS) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           00:10.9                         Foul: Shooting                                           LaMarcus Aldridge                                                   Kyle Lowry             CNC             Video
Comment:         Aldridge (SAS) maintains legal guarding position as he defends Lowry's (TOR) drive and shot attempt.
     Q4           00:09.9                        Foul: Loose Ball                                               Kyle Lowry                                                 LaMarcus Aldridge          CNC             Video
