Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

     Q4           01:50.0                         Foul: Personal                                              Amir Johnson                                                    Ian Mahinmi             CNC             Video
Comment:         Johnson (BOS) cleanly knocks away the pass intended for Mahinmi (IND).

Comment:         Mahinmi (IND) moves his pivot foot. Because of the defensive pressure by Johnson (BOS), the official is watching the defender to look for any
                 illegal contact and does not pick up the pivot foot.
     Q4           01:36.0                         Foul: Personal                                              Marcus Smart                                                      CJ Miles              CNC             Video
Comment:         Smart (BOS) cleanly strips the ball from Miles (IND).
     Q4           01:27.0                         Foul: Offensive                                              Ian Mahinmi                                                    Jae Crowder             CNC             Video
Comment:         Mahinmi (IND) sets the screen on Crowder (BOS) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           01:03.0                         Foul: Personal                                              Marcus Smart                                                    Paul George             CNC             Video
Comment:         RHH shows that Smart (BOS) maintains legal guarding position and Crowder (BOS) cleanly strips the ball from George (IND).
     Q4           00:32.8                         Foul: Shooting                                                Jordan Hill                                                  Isaiah Thomas            CNC             Video
Comment:         LHH shows that Hill (IND) maintains legal guarding position as he defends Thomas' (BOS) driving layup attempt. Any contact on the play is created by Thomas.
     Q4           00:30.9                         Foul: Shooting                                              Amir Johnson                                                      CJ Miles              CNC             Video

Comment:         After Thomas (BOS) secures the loose ball and begins to turn upcourt, George (IND) makes contact with him and affects his RSBQ.
