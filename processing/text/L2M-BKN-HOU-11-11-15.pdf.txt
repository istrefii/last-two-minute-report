Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

     Q4           01:35.0                         Foul: Offensive                                            Dwight Howard                                                 Bojan Bogdanovic           CNC             Video
Comment:         Howard (HOU) sets the screen on Bogdanovic (BKN) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           01:18.0                      Turnover: Traveling                                             Joe Johnson                                                                                            Video
Comment:         [Observable in enhanced video] During close defensive coverage, Johnson (BKN) moves his pivot foot heel-to-toe, changing his floor position. A player may move
                 heel-to-toe provided he doesn't gain space. Deemed unobservable because the referee must focus on the close contact.

     Q4           00:59.8                         Foul: Shooting                                            Thaddeus Young                                                     Ty Lawson              CNC             Video

Comment:         Lawson (HOU) commits a take foul on Jack (BKN).
     Q4           00:18.2                         Foul: Personal                                               Trevor Ariza                                                   Joe Johnson              CC             Video
Comment:         Ariza (HOU) commits a take foul on Johnson (BKN).
     Q4           00:18.2                         Foul: Offensive                                            Dwight Howard                                                    Jarrett Jack                            Video
