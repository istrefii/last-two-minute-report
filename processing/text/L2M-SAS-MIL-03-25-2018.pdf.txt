Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

     Q4            01:08.0           Instant Replay: Support Ruling                                                                                                                         IC        Video

Comment:           Per Rule 10.II, a player in control of a dribble may not step out of bounds and be the first player to touch the ball after re-establishing position inbounds. The referees deem
                   that Murray (SAS) controls his initial dribble, but deem him illegal (and blow the whistle) once his foot touches the baseline (even though he is not in contact with the ball),
                   rather than when he illegally touches the ball upon re-establishing inbounds. Accordingly, the whistle should have been deemed an inadvertent whistle and possession
                   should have been given to SAS.

Comment:           RHH shows Murray (SAS) maintains legal guarding position and makes incidental contact with Bledsoe (MIL) that does not cause
                   him to lose control of the ball.

Comment:           Aldridge (SAS) makes incidental contact with Antetokounmpo's (MIL) hand that does not affect his ability to retrieve the
                   rebound.
