Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         LATR and RATR shows that Cousins (SAC) sets the screen on Vujacic (NYK) and gives him room to avoid the contact. After the screen, the two players briefly engage and
                 separate.
     Q4           00:42.8                         Foul: Shooting                                            Kristaps Porzingis                                             DeMarcus Cousins           CNC             Video
Comment:         LHH shows that Porzingis (NYK) maintains legal guarding position as he defends Cousins' (SAC) move to the basket and shot attempt. Cousins is the last player to touch the
                 ball prior to it going OOB.

Comment:         Galloway (NYK) commits a take foul on Collison (SAC).
     Q4           00:08.3               Turnover: Backcourt Turnover                                           Arron Afflalo                                                                          CNC             Video
Comment:         Afflalo (NYK) cleanly strips the ball from Collison (SAC) but never gains possession in the front court which allows him to go into the backcourt to gain possession of the ball.
     Q4           00:02.9                         Foul: Personal                                               Rajon Rondo                                                  Carmelo Anthony           INC             Video
