Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

     Q4           01:54.0                         Foul: Personal                                           DeMarcus Cousins                                                 DeMar DeRozan             CNC             Video
Comment:         Cousins (SAC) and Gay (SAC) maintain legal guarding position as they trap DeRozan (TOR) by the baseline.
     Q4           01:29.0                         Foul: Personal                                               Rajon Rondo                                                     Kyle Lowry             CNC             Video
Comment:         Rondo (SAC) cleanly strips the ball from Lowry (TOR).
     Q4           01:23.0                         Foul: Shooting                                            DeMarre Carroll                                                  Marco Belinelli          CNC             Video
Comment:         Carroll (TOR) legally contests Belinelli's (SAC) shot attempt. Contact only occurs when Belinelli extends his leg, however the contact is incidental and does not warrant an
                 offensive foul.

Comment:         LATR shows that Joseph (TOR) maintains legal guarding position and Lowry (TOR) makes contact with Gay's (SAC) wrist after the ball has been released and the contact
                 does not affect his layup attempt.
     Q4           00:41.3                         Foul: Personal                                               Cory Joseph                                                 DeMarcus Cousins            IC             Video

Comment:         Biyombo (TOR) does not affect Cousins' (SAC) RSBQ on his drive to the basket.
     Q4           00:27.2                      Turnover: Traveling                                         DeMarcus Cousins                                                                           CNC             Video

     Q4           00:21.3                         Foul: Shooting                                           DeMarcus Cousins                                                 DeMar DeRozan             CNC             Video
