Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

Comment:             After the made shot, with no timeouts remaining for either team, Coach Thibodeau (MIN) can be seen quickly signaling a timeout
                     behind the back of the slot official and then immediately waving his players up the court. By the time the referee is in a position
                     to notice Thibodeau, he is not signaling a timeout and play moves up the court.

      Q4             00:03.2           Foul: Offensive                                      Karl-Anthony Towns                                    Paul George                   INC      Video
Comment:             While contact is hard, this is a close play in transition. Multiple angles show Towns (MIN) establishes a screening position in
                     Georgeâ€™s (OKC) path before the contact and he absorbs the contact when it occurs. However, his stance is wide and contact
                     occurs to his leg area, which makes the screen illegal.
