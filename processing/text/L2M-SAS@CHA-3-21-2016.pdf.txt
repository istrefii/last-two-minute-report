Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during overtime,
where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the outcome of a
possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch, zoom or other
technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further review, particularly when a
new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         Duncan (SAS) extends his leg into Walker's (CHA) path, without giving him room to avoid the contact and contact occurs to Duncan's leg.

Comment:         [Observable in production angle] Leonard (SAS) appears to maintain a legal guarding position on Lin (CHA). There is no angle that conclusively shows he places two
                 hands on him above the free-throw line extended (which is illegal).
     Q4           00:33.1                  Foul: Shooting                                                     Nicolas Batum                                                  Kawhi Leonard            CNC             Video
Comment:         Batum (CHA) legally contests Leonard (SAS) jump shot attempt. Any "high-five" contact after the release is considered incidental.

Comment:         Batum (CHA) legally contests Leonard (SAS) jump shot attempt, giving him room to land. Any "high-five" contact after the release is considered incidental.

Comment:         Duncan (SAS) firms up as he sets the screen on Walker (CHA) and gives him room to avoid the contact. The two players make incidental contact that causes Duncan
                 to lose his balance.
     Q4           00:07.0                        Foul: Loose Ball                                               Cody Zeller                                                LaMarcus Aldridge                          Video
Comment:         [Incidental or immaterial] Zeller (CHA) briefly grabs Aldridge's (SAS) jersey on the rebound, but it does not affect Aldridge's ability to get the rebound.
     Q4           00:04.4                         Foul: Shooting                                                Jeremy Lin                                                    Danny Green             CNC             Video
