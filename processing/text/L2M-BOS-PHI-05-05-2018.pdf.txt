Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

Comment:           Rozier (BOS) briefly grasps Belinelli's (PHI) jersey but does not affect his FOM off ball.

     Q4            01:49.0            Foul: Personal                                           Marcus Smart                                        JJ Redick            CNC         Video
Comment:           Smart (BOS) moves laterally into Redick's (PHI) path and makes marginal contact that does not affect his SQBR.


                  01:46.1                                01:33.0

Comment:           RATR shows Simmons (PHI) maintains legal guarding position and makes incidental contact with Tatum (BOS) that does not
                   affect his SQBR.

                  01:33.1                                                                    01:10.0

Comment:           Redick (PHI) moves to establish a screen on Tatum (BOS), who is stationary and can see Redick approaching. When establishing a
                   screening position in a stationary defenders path who can see the screener, the screener does not need to give the defender
                   room to avoid the contact.
     Q4            01:15.0         Foul: Personal                                                Al Horford                                       Joel Embiid           CNC         Video
Comment:           Horford (BOS) does not make contact to Embiid's (PHI) arm on the rip-through.

     Q4            01:14.0            Foul: Shooting                                             Al Horford                                       Joel Embiid           CNC         Video
Comment:           Horford (BOS) legally contests Embiid's (PHI) jump shot attempt. Any "high-five" contact after the release is considered
                   incidental.

                  01:10.1                                                                                  00:48.6

Comment:           Horford (BOS) establishes a legal screening position on Belinelli (PHI) and gives him room to avoid the contact.

     Q4            00:55.5            Foul: Offensive                                            Al Horford                                   Marco Belinelli           CNC         Video
Comment:           Horford (BOS) makes marginal contact with Belinelli (PHI) that does not affect his FOM.

     Q4            00:51.0            Foul: Loose Ball                                            JJ Redick                                   Jaylen Brown              CNC         Video
Comment:           Brown (BOS) cuts toward the rim and Redick (PHI) retreats and maintains a legal guarding position. LATR shows Brown does not
                   run through or extend an arm into Redick, and the players trip each other up while performing normal basketball moves.

Comment:           Smart (BOS) does not maintain a legal guarding position and makes contact with Belinelli (PHI) that affects his driving shot
                   attempt.

Comment:     Simmons (PHI) maintains legal guarding position and makes incidental contact with Brown (BOS) that does not cause him to lose
             control of the ball.
    Q4       00:31.1           Foul: Defense 3 Second                                     Joel Embiid                                                                          Video
Comment:     [Incidental or immaterial] Embiid (PHI) walks along the edge of the paint and and fails to fully exit the lane within three seconds.

    Q4       00:25.8          Foul: Personal                                            Ersan Ilyasova                                      Jaylen Brown             CNC       Video
Comment:     Ilyasova (PHI) and Brown (BOS) make marginal contact with one another and disengage.

    Q4       00:24.7          Foul: Shooting                                            Ersan Ilyasova                                      Jaylen Brown             CNC       Video
Comment:     Ilyasova (PHI) maintains legal guarding position as he defends Brown's (BOS) shot attempt near the rim.


             00:24.1                                                    00:04.7

Comment:     Simmons (PHI) turns into Embiid (PHI) causing him to fall to the floor. During the contact, Morris (BOS) briefly grasps Simmons'
             jersey and releases, but the contact is unrelated to the contact between Simmons and Embiid.

Comment:     Rozier (BOS) gathers the ball on his left foot, then takes two legal steps before jumping off his left foot and releasing the ball
             before returning to the floor.
    Q4       00:01.8          Foul: Shooting                                            T.J. McConnell                                      Jaylen Brown             CNC       Video

Comment:     After communicating with the Replay Center, the ruling on the floor of a successful 2pt field goal by Belinelli (PHI) prior to the
             expiration of the game clock is confirmed.

Comment:     Tatum (BOS) makes marginal contact with Belinelli (PHI) that does not affect his ability to retrieve the rebound.

    Q5       01:59.0          Foul: Loose Ball                                          Ben Simmons                                        Jayson Tatum              CNC       Video
Comment:     RATR shows Simmons (PHI) makes incidental contact with Tatum (BOS) during rebounding while legally attempting to get his
             hand on the ball. Tatum turns abruptly and falls.

Comment:     RATR shows Embiid (PHI) establishes a wide screening position in Larkin's (BOS) path, but firms up when contact occurs and
             the contact is not to his leg or foot.
    Q5       01:44.0           Foul: Loose Ball                                        Joel Embiid                                    Shane Larkin                   CNC       Video
Comment:     Embiid (PHI) briefly engages with Larkin (BOS) after the made shot attempt as the two position themselves for a potential
             rebound.

Comment:     RATR shows that Redick (PHI) establishes a screening position behind Morris (BOS) and initiates some contact. However, RATR
             shows that Morris is moving along with Redick and that Redick is not dislodging Morris. The screener may move in the same
             direction as the player they are screening.

             shot attempt.
