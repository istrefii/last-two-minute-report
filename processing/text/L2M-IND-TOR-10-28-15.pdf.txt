Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         RHH shows Biyombo (TOR) jumps vertically with George (IND), remains vertical, and absorbs the contact.
     Q4           00:37.6                        Foul: Loose Ball                                               Jordan Hill                                                Jonas Valanciunas           CC             Video

Comment:         Hill (IND) gives DeRozan (TOR) enough room to avoid the screen and he absorbs contact. DeRozan's contact with Hill (IND) is incidental.

Comment:         Hill (IND) beats Carroll (TOR) to the spot (point of contact), giving him enough room to avoid the screen.
     Q4           00:18.2                      Foul: Personal Take                                              George Hill                                                 DeMar DeRozan              CC             Video

Comment:         Since Carroll (TOR) is moving to the side of Hill (IND) and Hill is not yet shooting, contact on this play is incidental and does not warrant a foul call.
     Q4           00:14.5               Instant Replay: Overturn Ruling                                                                                                                                CC             Video
Comment:         After communicating with the Replay Center, the officials determined that Hill (IND) was fouled while attempting a three-point field goal and the ruling on the floor was
                 overturned.
     Q4           00:12.4                      Foul: Personal Take                                             Lavoy Allen                                                 Jonas Valanciunas           CC             Video

Comment:         Since Carroll (TOR) is jumping past George (IND) and would have missed him had George not jumped forward into him, this is not a shooting foul.
