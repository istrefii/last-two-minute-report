Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during overtime,
where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the outcome of a
possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch, zoom or other
technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are denoted with an *. The league may change an opinion after further review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If
you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:        RHH shows Jones (HOU) and Griffin (LAC) tangle momentarily, with Griffin lifting Jones's arms toward himself as he runs through.

     Q4           01:35.0                         Foul: Shooting                                               Trevor Ariza                                                   Matt Barnes              CC             Video
Comment:        RATR shows Ariza (HOU) is jumping toward Barnes (LAC) and turning in the air as Barnes attempts his layup.

Comment:        Paul (LAC) does not affect Harden's (HOU) RSBQ on his drive into the paint. A defensive player is permitted to momentarily touch an opponent with his hand
                anywhere on the court as long as he does not affect the opponent's RSBQ.
     Q4          01:11.0                   Foul: Shooting                                                   DeAndre Jordan                                                Donatas Motiejunas          CNC             Video

Comment:        Motiejunas (HOU) is vertical in his attempt to defend Paul's (LAC) layup attempt. Paul kicks his leg out unnaturally, but the kick does not hit or affect Motiejunas's
                ability to defend.

Comment:       Ariza (HOU) establishes his left foot as his pivot foot and makes a legal reverse pivot while attempting to inbound the ball.

     Q4           00:12.0                 Turnover: 5 Second Inbound                                           Trevor Ariza                                                                           CNC*            Video
