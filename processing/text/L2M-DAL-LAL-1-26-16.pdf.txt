Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         RHH shows that Nowtizki (DAL) makes incidental contact with Clarkson's (LAL) arm that does not affect his driving shot attempt.
     Q4           01:26.0                         Foul: Shooting                                               Lou Williams                                                 Jose Juan Barea           CNC             Video
Comment:         Williams (LAL) maintains legal guarding position and cleanly blocks Barea's (DAL) driving layup attempt.
     Q4           00:37.2                        Foul: Loose Ball                                            Jordan Clarkson                                                 Deron Williams           CNC             Video
Comment:         Clarkson (LAL) and Williams (DAL) make incidental contact with one another during rebounding.
     Q4           00:34.5                      Turnover: Traveling                                              Nick Young                                                                            CNC             Video

Comment:         R-Slash shows that Barea (DAL) clamps and pulls Williams' (LAL) arm on the drive, and then falls back from him. The trail official incorrectly makes the offensive call on
                 Williams because he only sees Barea's histrionics, not the clamp.
