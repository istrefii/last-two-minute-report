Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

Comment:         Wade (MIA) legally contests Lee's (CHA) transition layup attempt. Wade does not touch the ball and his contact with the backboard does not affect the ability for the ball
                 to score.
     Q4           01:07.0                         Foul: Shooting                                             Dwyane Wade                                                      Courtney Lee            CNC             Video

Comment:         Lee (CHA) maintains legal guarding position as he defends Wade's (MIA) drive. Wade initiates contact on the play and briefly loses control of the ball.
     Q4           00:09.7                         Foul: Personal                                              Courtney Lee                                                   Dwyane Wade              CNC             Video

     Q4           00:07.8                         Foul: Shooting                                             Kemba Walker                                                     Goran Dragic            CNC             Video
Comment:         Walker (CHA) cleanly blocks Dragic's (MIA) jump shot attempt.
     Q4           00:05.2                         Foul: Shooting                                                Cody Zeller                                                  Dwyane Wade              CNC             Video
Comment:         Zeller (CHA) comes towards Wade (MIA) from across the restricted area, planting his foot and jumping vertically to defend Wade’s shot. Zeller absorbs
                 contact when it occurs and, while his arms are not completely vertical, multiple angles confirm they do not make contact with Wade. Therefore, Zeller
                 maintains a legal guarding position as he attempts to defend the shot.

Comment:         Lee (CHA) makes contact with the ball during Wade’s (MIA) upward shooting motion, which makes his subsequent, minor arm contact with Wade
                 incidental. Lee then makes contact with Wade’s arm again at about 00:04.9, however, Wade has already lost possession of the ball.
