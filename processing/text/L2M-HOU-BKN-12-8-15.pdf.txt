Below is the league’s assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night’s games which were within five points at the two-minute mark (and during
overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly related to the
outcome of a possession. Calls that are indirectly related to the outcome (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a
stop-watch, zoom or other technical support, but have some merit in reporting, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments. The league may change an opinion after further
review, particularly when a new video angle becomes available. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA Communications Department.

     Q4           01:51.0                         Foul: Offensive                                              Brook Lopez                                                   Corey Brewer              CC             Video

     Q4           01:42.0                    Foul: Defense 3 Second                                            Brook Lopez                                                                            INC             Video
Comment:         Lopez (BKN) is in the paint without actively guarding an opponent for longer than three seconds.
     Q4           01:34.0                         Foul: Personal                                            Patrick Beverley                                                  Brook Lopez             CNC             Video
Comment:         Beverley (HOU) cleanly strips the ball from Lopez (BKN).
     Q4           01:06.0                         Foul: Offensive                                              Brook Lopez                                                   Corey Brewer             CNC             Video
Comment:         Lopez (BKN) sets the screen on Brewer (HOU) and gives him room to avoid the contact.
     Q4           01:01.0                         Foul: Shooting                                              Corey Brewer                                                    Joe Johnson              CC             Video
Comment:         Brewer (HOU) makes contact with Johnson's (BKN) body that affects his shot attempt.
     Q4           00:58.0                  Stoppage: Out-of-Bounds                                                                                                                                     CC             Video
Comment:         Correctly called OOB which was last touched by Brown (BKN). Houston retains possession.

     Q4           00:46.5                      Turnover: Traveling                                            Corey Brewer                                                                            INC             Video
Comment:         As Jack (BKN) comes to defend Brewer (HOU) and makes incidental contact, Brewer spins away and travels. The official’s primary focus is the contact, and he doesn’t
                 pick up the illegal pivot movement.
     Q4           00:42.2                         Foul: Shooting                                               Brook Lopez                                                    Jason Terry              CC             Video
Comment:         Terry (HOU) starts the drive outside the LBD. Lopez (BKN) is the secondary defender and on the floor in the RA when contact occurs, so Terry's shooting motion
                 cannot be deemed unnatural.
     Q4           00:40.1                         Foul: Personal                                            Marcus Thornton                                                   Joe Johnson             INC             Video
Comment:         L-SLASH shows that as defenders converge on Johnson (BKN), Thornton (HOU) makes contact with Johnson's arm, causing him to lose the ball.
     Q4           00:35.7                         Foul: Shooting                                              Markel Brown                                                   James Harden              CC             Video
Comment:         Brown (BKN) makes contact with Harden's (HOU) arm that affects his drive to the basket and layup attempt.
     Q4           00:09.5                      Turnover: Traveling                                              Jarrett Jack                                                                          INC             Video
Comment:         Jack (BKN) changes his pivot foot after securing the loose ball.
     Q4           00:08.0                         Foul: Personal                                              Corey Brewer                                                    Jarrett Jack             CC             Video
Comment:         Brewer (HOU) commits a take foul on Jack (BKN).
