Below is the league's assessment of officiated events that occurred in the last two minutes of last night's games that were at or within three points during any point in the last two-minutes of
the fourth quarter (and overtime, where applicable). The plays assessed include all calls (whistles) and notable non-calls. Notable non-calls will generally be defined as material plays directly
related to the outcome of a possession. Similar to our instant replay standards, there must be clear and conclusive video evidence in order to make a determination that a play was incorrectly
officiated. Events that are indirectly related to the outcome of a possession (e.g., a non-call on contact away from the play) and/or plays that are only observable with the help of a stop-watch,
zoom or other technical support, are noted in brackets along with the explanatory comments but are not deemed to be incorrectly officiated. The league may change its view after further
review. If you have any questions, please contact the NBA here.

Comment:           Mack (ORL) makes marginal contact with Thomas (LAL) that does not affect his ability to pass.

Comment:           Kuzma (LAL) legally contests Gordon's (ORL) jump shot attempt. Any "high-five" contact after the release is considered
                   incidental.

Comment:           Ball (LAL) makes marginal contact with Simmons (ORL) that does not affect his drive to the basket and shot attempt.

Comment:           Lopez (LAL) sets the screen on Simmons (ORL) and gives him room to avoid the contact. The two players briefly engage following
                   the screen.

Comment:           LHH shows Ball (LAL) makes contact with the ball, but also with Simmons' (ORL) wrist and the contact causes him to lose control
                   of the ball.

Comment:             Caldwell-Pope (LAL) maintains legal guarding position and makes incidental contact with Gordon (ORL) that does not affect his
                     drive to the basket and shot attempt.

Comment:             RHH shows Vucevic (ORL) makes contact to Lopez's (LAL) head and affects his shot attempt.

      Q4             00:00.6           Other                                                                                                                                    IC       Video
Comment:             On the inbound pass, referees were reasonably certain that there was a clock malfunction and triggered an Instant Replay under
                     Rule 13.1.a.5. After review, it is confirmed that the game clock was inadvertently started by the referee crew and that time
                     expired before the ball was touched. The clock is correctly reset to 0:00.6. However, since the pass was still in the air when the
                     clock expired, the ball was still in ORLâ€™s possession and thus ORL should have retained possession on the sideline at the nearest
                     spot. Had the ball been touched by LAL prior to the expiration of the clock, it would have been considered a loose ball and the
                     jump ball ruling would have been correct.
