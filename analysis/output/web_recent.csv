Q4,0:00:36.400000,36.4,Foul: Shooting,LeBron James,Kevin Durant,CC,"The crew was not reasonably certain whether James (CLE) was in the restricted area after an offensive foul was called against Durant (GSW). Upon replay review, it was confirmed that James was outside the restricted area. The referees also reviewed whether James was in a legal guarding position, which is an additional reviewable matter for this replay trigger. Replay showed James was not in a legal guarding position because he was turning his body and moving into Durant when contact occurred. Thus the initial call on the floor was overturned and James was assessed a blocking foul. 00:36.5",http://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0041700401&eventNum=575,20180531CLEGSW,20180531CLEGSW-5,GSW,CLE,
